CURRENTLY DOING MASSIVE OVERHAUL

#Phonology

Phonotactic ideas:

- Two vowels together must share a quality, like height
- fricatives can't occur after plosives
- /f/ can only occur in onset
- plosives can occur only in onset, either they become fricatives elsewhere or just drop
- plosives can occur only word initially

# Nouns

Case examples must be added once verbs are done.

# Verbs

several subsections to discuss each feature in this order:

- interrogative mood
- imperative mood
- gerunds
- participles

then make a section to show tables with each verb in all possible
inflections much like the inflection noun section

---Things to Add Later---

add example sentences for each word in the dictionary. Whether it actually shows will be random

at the bottom, generate a block of text when all parts of speech have been
given. There will be several templates, chosen at random (there will be a button
to cycle through different templates without changing the rest of the page). e.g
&{det} &{adj} &{noun} &{verb} &{conj} that white horse ran

Make it so that the input section does not show on printed PDFs, turn the scroll sections
into-non- scrolling sections in printed PDFs

add different typologies (isolating, aglutinative, fusional) and the ability to have them
be randomly chosen

Specfiic features also become random. Like what, if any, cases, aspects, tenses etc
are present, and also how these features are even marked. Based either on user choice or random choice. This will mean a high
amount of variability in the paragraphs that explain these things

add more than one meaning to a word, make a psuedo thesaurus? - if a word has related
terms listed, then the other terms will also be assigned at random

when making compounds for dictionary, have each part of a compound be from a specific set of nouns chosen by their meaning e.g

- COLOUR-ANIMAL
- COLOUR-PLANT
- TRADE-PERSON
- SIZE-ANIMAL
- COLOUR-FOOD
  etc, to ensure that the compounds aren't totally nonsensical.

##Features to be randomized/chosen:

- Stative verbs vs nominal adjectives
- If adjectives agree at all, and if so, with what
- Verb tenses
- Verb mood
- Verb aspect
- Derivational methods
- Different sets of vocabulary for different climates and cultures? i.e marine terms vs desert vs tundra etc
- Sets of words to be chosen based on a random culture and habitat. So the vocabulary has a sense of cohesion e.g not having a word both for camel and polarbear
- Add a placename and personalname generator, which randomly selects a style of name derivation and then generates names using that.
- Generator for the language name. The name can be derived from a fictional place where it is spoken (using a generated placename), or by using a random noun or adjective + the word language, or by creating an ethnonym for the speakers and then using that + the word language
