CURRENTLY DOING MASSIVE OVERHAUL
Finish the phonology before doing anything else, even though the rest of the page looks like a mess currently

#Phonology

Phonotactic ideas:
Two vowels together must share a quality, like height
fricatives can't occur after plosives
/f/ can only occur in onset
plosives can occur only in onset, either they become fricatives elsewhere or just drop


voiceless vowels?????? maybe not

palatalised and lanialised consonants

#Verbs

several subsections to discuss each feature in this order:

- interrogative mood
- imperative mood
- gerunds
- participles

then make a section to show tables with each verb in all possible
inflections much like the inflection noun section

---Things to Add Later---

Upon generation, EVERY english word will be assigned a randomly generated word,
it is from these arrays that the words throughout the document will be pulled from
this will also allow me to generate the dictionary at the end. Perhaps I
should remove users choice to generate an amount of words and their
meanings?

at the bottom, generate a block of text when all parts of speech have been
given. There will be several templates, chosen at random (there will be a button
to cycle through different templates without changing the rest of the page). e.g
&{det} &{adj} &{noun} &{verb} &{conj} that white horse ran

Make is so that the phonology section is below the submit button, and that it changes
based on user input.

create a large amount of sound change and have them be chosen at random to give
a degree or randomness to the sound changes, right now they are baked in

Generate a bilingual dictionary at the very end

Make it so that the input section does not show on printed PDFs, turn the scroll sections
into-non- scrolling sections in printed PDFs

add different typologies (isolating, aglutinative, fusional) and the ability to have them
be randomly chosen

Specfiic features also become random. Like what, if any, cases, aspects, tenses etc
are present, and also how these features are even marked. Based either on user choice or random choice. This will mean a high
amount of variability in the paragraphs that explain these things

Let user decide how to spell long vowels

add more than one meaning to a word, make a psuedo thesaurus? - if a word has related
terms listed, then the other terms will also be assigned at random

Features to be randomized/chosen:
Stative verbs vs nominal verbs
Word order
What noun cases there are
If adjectives agree at all, and if so, with what
Verb tenses
Verb mood
Verb aspect
Derivational methods
Different sets of vocabulary for different climates and cultures?
i.e marine terms vs desert vs tundra etc

Sets of words to be chosen based on a random culture and habitat. So the vocabulary has a sense of cohesion e.g not having a word both for camel and polarbear

Add a placename and personalname generator, which randomly selects a style of name derivation and then generates names using that.

Generator for the language name. The name can be derived from a fictional place where it is spoken (using a generated placename), or by using a random noun or adjective + the word language, or by creating an ethnonym for the speakers and then using that + the word language
