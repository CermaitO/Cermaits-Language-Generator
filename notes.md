#Verbs

several subsections to discuss each feature in this order:

- interrogative mood
- imperative mood
- gerunds
- participles

then make a section to show tables with each verb in all possible
inflections much like the inflection noun section

---

at the bottom, generate a block of text when all parts of speech have been
given. There will be several templates, chosen at random (there will be a button
to cycle through different templates without changing the rest of the page). e.g
&{det} &{adj} &{noun} &{verb} &{conj} that white horse ran
