#Verbs

several subsections to discuss each feature in this order:

- interrogative mood
- imperative mood
- gerunds
- participles

then make a section to show tables with each verb in all possible
inflections much like the inflection noun section

---Things to Add Later---

at the bottom, generate a block of text when all parts of speech have been
given. There will be several templates, chosen at random (there will be a button
to cycle through different templates without changing the rest of the page). e.g
&{det} &{adj} &{noun} &{verb} &{conj} that white horse ran

Make is so that the phonology section is below the submit button, and that it changes
 based on user input.

create a large amount of sound change and have them be chosen at random to give
a degree or randomness to the sound changes, right now they are baked in

Generate a bilingual dictionary at the very end

Make it so that the input section does not show on printed PDFs, turn the scroll sections
into-non- scrolling sections in printed PDFs

add different typologies (isolating, aglutinative, fusional) and the ability to have them
 be randomly chosen

Specfiic features also become random. Like what, if any, cases, aspects, tenses etc
are present, and also how these features are even marked. Based either on user choice or random choice. This will mean a high
amount of variability in the paragraphs that explain these things

Features to be randomized/chosen
Stative verbs vs nominal verbs
Word order
Syllable structure
What noun cases there are
If adjectives agree at all, and if so, with what
Verb tenses
Verb mood
Verb aspect
Derivational methods
