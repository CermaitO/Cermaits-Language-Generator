      <h2>What is <span class="language-name">Kerbekulo</span>?</h2>

      <p>
        <span class="language-name">Kerbekulo</span> is a fictional language,
        made up purely for the purposes of this generator, which I made to
        practice JavaScript while indulging in my love of languages.
        <span class="language-name">Kerbekulo</span> has a fixed set of affixes
        and a fixed morphophonology, however I have not created any words
        because that would take the fun away from this generator! Here, you can
        create the words yourself and see how they inflect and compound
        together. First, enter the words and then read how the fit into the
        language! When printing to PDF, check both "headers and footers" and
        "background graphics".

          both causing the voiced consonant to no longer be word final:
