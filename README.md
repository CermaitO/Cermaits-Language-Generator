#Kerbeluko Language Generator

The Kerbeluko Language Generator is program that allows users to automatically generate a fictional language. The language itself has a fixed grammatical frame, but the user is able to enter his own words at will and see how they fit into the provioded grammatical frame. The program is a novelty that any language nerd can appreciate.

##Features 

* Automatic root generation 
	The user is able to have roots *automatically generated* using the letters that he provided.
* Automatic inflection
	All nouns, adjective and verb roots that are entered are automatically inflected.
* Dynamic page
	With each generation, the text of the page, which is a grammatical description of this language, changes to include the user's own submitted words in each example.

##How to Use

After the description of the language's phonotactics, there are a series of text fields which promt the user to input certain types of words such as nouns, adjectives, verbs, prepositions and such. The user may also add or remove which letters he wishes the language to have. Then the user must click "submit" to see the newly created language.

###How the Language is Created

This program makes heavy use of JavaScript and the DOM to create and inflect words, and then display the results on the page.
